# hello-world
first bash at learning Git in the real world!
I am hoping to make changes to my career to prepare me for the 'real world' in the 2020's!
I am assuming that these preparations include basic coding, and so am keen to learn more, practising what I learn in order to 'commit' to memory ;-). 
These preparations have already shown me how far I have dropped behind the tide, with the basic elements of coding used in various applications now becoming apparent and making sense to me!
