# hello-world
first bash at learning Git in the real world!
I am hoping to make changes to my career to prepare me for the 'real world' in the 2020's!
I am assuming that these preparations include basic coding. 
These preparations have already shown me how far I am dropping behind with the basic elements of coding being used in various applications now making sense to me!
